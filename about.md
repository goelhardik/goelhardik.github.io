<p class="message">
  I am a second year <strong>Computer Science</strong> MS student, working with <a href="http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~banerjee/">Professor Arindam Banerjee</a> at the <a href="https://twin-cities.umn.edu/">University of Minnesota,     Twin Cities</a>.
My interests lie in the fields of <strong>Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence</strong>.
<br />
Currently, I am exploring Deep Learning techniques on aviation data for flight safety.

<i>MS, Computer Science</i> <img src='../images/umnlogo.jpg'/ height="140" width="200" align="right"/>
<li>I am working here towards building a system for the detection of precursors to anomalous flight events. This is a NASA project intended to be deployed in real-time systems to predict anomalous events and enhance flight safety. Currently, we are exploring [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory)s as a potential method to detect precursors.</li> 
<li>I was also the Teaching Assistant for [CSci 4061](http://www-users.cselabs.umn.edu/classes/Spring-2016/csci4061/) - Introduction to Operating Systems, for Spring 2016. I designed projects, conducted recitations and held office hours for questions on the material.</li>
